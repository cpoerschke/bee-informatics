# Bee Informatics

Once you've kept and learnt about honeybees for a few years and if you've professionally developed software for even longer than that, the next step seems almost inevitable: you wanna do something with bees _and_ computers. This intersection of [Apiculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping) and [Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) could perhaps be called "bee informatics" and in this repository I'm hoping to share some of my adventures in this area.

## About me

Christine Poerschke is a spare-time beekeeper in suburban London since 2010 and a member of her local beekeepers' association. She joined [Bloomberg](http://techatbloomberg.com) as a software developer in 2004, after completing a PhD entitled ["Development and evaluation of an intelligent handheld insulin dose advisor for patients with Type 1 diabetes"](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.401010). Christine is an active open source contributor who likes to include a little bit of bee content in technical presentations e.g. the ["Open Source Search with Apache Lucene/Solr"](https://www.bbhub.io/labs/sites/20/2016/10/ghc-2016-christine-poerschke.pdf) poster at GHC2016 in Houston and the ["Learning-to-Rank with Apache Solr and Bees"](https://www.slideshare.net/lucidworks/learningtorank-with-apache-solr-bees-christine-poerschke-bloomberg) talk with [repo](https://github.com/cpoerschke/ltr-with-bees) at [Lucene/Solr Revolution](http://lucenerevolution.org) 2017 in Las Vegas. She occasionally tweets as [@BeeChristineP](https://twitter.com/BeeChristineP) and enjoys learning more about bees, both from her own honeybees and by studying for the [British Beekeepers Association](https://www.bbka.org.uk)'s module examinations.
